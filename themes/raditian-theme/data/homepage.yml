  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My areas of focus lie in designing home and small buisiness Wired and Wireless Networks.
    This can be as small as a single user home network, or a  small buisiness with a Wired and Wireless network with multiple users.
    Both scenarios are treated the same and it is essential that the customers requirements and expectations are clarified at the onset.
    I also offer assistance with the configuration and setup of end end user devices, beit Mac, PC or peripheral devices.
    I endeavour to treat each customer as if i were dealing with my own home or buisiness, carry out the work to the best of my ability and provide a good customer experience through out the process
