  title: "Hello, Iâ€™m Chris Mann"
  subtitle: "Network IT Specialist"
  description: "I've spent an entire career spanning 40 years in the IT industry in one guise or another.

Having retired from my role as a Network Manager & Engineer, I'm now using my extensive IT skills and qualifications to help family, friends and local businesses with their technical queries.

I've been told many times that I should set up my own business, and until now, have been happy doing the odd job for satisfied family members, friends and referrals. However, after receiving a big push from a local client, I've now taken the plunge and started my own specialist IT business to continue putting my experience into action. 

Please get in touch if you want to find out how I can help you. I'd love to hear from you."

  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My area of expertise lies in designing Wired and Wireless Networks for homes and small businesses. 
    In the past this has ranged from single user home Networks to smaller businesses with both Wired and Wireless Networks and multiple users. 
    I am also fully proficient in advising and executing the configuration and setup of end user devices including Mac, PC or peripheral devices. 
    Of course, both scenarios are treated equally, and I will always treat each client with respect and fairness, as if I were dealing with my own home or business. 
    We will work together to ensure your requirements are understood and expectations clarified from the outset. 
    Throughout the process you will also be kept up to date with progress and developments to ensure transparency
